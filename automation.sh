* What is VCS? Version control system?
--------------------------------------------------
VCS - Version control system is an mechanism which provides an unique identification for managing the data inside the files via commit_id which is an hexa decimal code  in the form of 125/256 bytes using algorithm called "SHA key" - Secure hashing algorithm.

eg: commit_id - nxni9bd200dh2idhihdnhnbd21dn21

   Every changes will be recorded via commit_id to track the changes and avoid duplication of the data.
